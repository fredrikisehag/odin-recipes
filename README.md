# odin-recipes

Before the project:
I am following "The Odin Project" Curriculum and have just "Finished" the lectures about HTML.
In this project I am told to do a recipe site. I will be working with different tags and elements
that has been taught throughout the lectures. This will probably include things like headings,
images and links. This will give me a better understanding of HTML.
